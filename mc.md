## About Magic Farm 3
since original official forge installer had some issue, here's a [patched version of it](https://github.com/asef18766/asef18766.github.io/releases/download/0.0.0/forge-1.7.10-10.13.4.1566-1.7.10-installer.jar). however, you can still also use Multi-MC or CurseForge to install either.

another issue is MF3 had some bug in CurseForge client mod bundle. please use [our mod pack](https://github.com/asef18766/asef18766.github.io/releases/download/0.0.0/Magic.Farm.3.Harvest.zip) instead.
